### Abstract

The GIA Hypothesis proposes that **identity** in intelligent systems (human or artificial) is not defined by secrets, biometrics, or explicit tokens, but by the **topological invariant** of the reachable state set under natural interactions.

Formally:

\boxed{\text{Identity} = \text{Topology}\big(\text{Reach}(X_0, U, t)\big)}

Where:
- **X₀**: Initial latent/behavioral state  
- **U**: Allowed inputs/behavioral signals  
- **t**: Evolution (time/interaction steps)  
- **Reach(X₀, U, t)**: Set of all reachable states  
- **Topology(·)**: Extracts invariants (e.g., persistent homology, Betti numbers, cycles)

In plain terms: **Identity is the stable geometric shape of how you navigate state-space**, not what you remember or show.

### Core Claims

1. Each human generates a **unique topological signature** stable across devices, modalities, and surface variations (stress, fatigue, typing speed).  
2. This signature **persists over time** via invariant structure, not brittle memory.  
3. Imposters (deepfakes, AI clones, stolen data) **cannot reproduce** the reachable manifold topology.  
4. Authentication works **cross-modally** (typing → voice → gait → browsing) due to isomorphism.

### Testable Predictions

| # | Prediction | Description | Falsification Risk |
|---|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Cross-Modality Identity | Same user across keyboard/voice/touch → isomorphic topologies; impostor diverges | Two users yield identical invariants |
| 2 | Stress/Emotion Robustness | Invariant survives fatigue, illness, distraction | User's topology shifts unpredictably under stress |
| 3 | Impersonation Impossibility | Deepfakes/recordings/mimicry fail to match topology | Impostor reconstructs invariant consistently |
| 4 | Short-Window Sufficiency | 1–2 seconds of interaction suffices for manifold inference | Topology requires long traces to stabilize |
| 5 | Zero-Secret Authentication | No passwords/tokens needed; identity is implicit geometry | System requires explicit secrets to function |
